    <h2 class="title">A quick and easy Spanish recipe for Spanish Garlic Shrimp (Gambas al Ajillo)</h2>

    <p>Gambas al ajillo are on every Spanish restaurant menu — for good reason! It's a dish of shrimp cloaked in garlic-infused olive oil with smoky hints of paprika and a touch of sweetness from sherry. Make sure you have all your ingredients together before you head to the stove since, start to finish, this cooks in mere minutes. It's great for a tapas party since you can prep everything ahead of time. Just spoon the shrimp and sauce over toasted bread and sprinkle more cayenne and parsley on top to enjoy. </p>

        <li>1 pound frozen large shrimp (21-25 count) - thawed, peeled, and deveined</li>
